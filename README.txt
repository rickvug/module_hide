Module Hide
-----------

Module Hide allows modules to be hidden from the module administration page.
For example, you can easily remove PHP filter, example modules, Date PHP4 and
various other nuisances. In the future this module may also be helpful to
Drupal distributions who want to present their users with more streamlined
options.

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Copy to the modules directory of your choice and enable. Module settings are
at admin/settings/module_hide. Select the modules you would like to hide. Next
time you visit admin/build/modules the modules you selected will be hidden.

Notes
-----

* This module is very much a work in progress. DO NOT EXPECT AN UPGRADE PATH
BEFORE AN OFFICIAL RELEASE IS MADE.
* Module Hide requires Drupal 6.21 (not released as of writing) or the latest
Drupal 6 development snapshot. Alternately the following bugfix patch may
be applied manually: http://drupal.org/node/764548#comment-3025492.
